# Interesting Math Stuff
This repository is to keep note of math theorems and problems which I found to be interesting.

### 1. Chessboard tiling problem [Liu C.L Elements of Discrete Mathematics]

Suppose we remove a square from a standard 8x8 chessboard .Given $21$ L-shaped triominoes , we want to know whether it is possible to tile the $63$ remaining squares of the chessboard with the triominoes. (By tiling the remaining squares of the chess-board, we mean covering each of them exactly once without parts of the triominoes extending over the removed square or the edges of the board.)

### 2. Ore's theorem 
Let $G(V, E)$ be a simple graph such that for every pair of **non adjacent** vertices $u$ and $v$ , $d(u) + d(v) >= |V|$ then , $G$ contains a **Hamiltonian cycle**
