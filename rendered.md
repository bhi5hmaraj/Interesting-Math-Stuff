This repo is to keep note of math theorems and problems that I found out to be interesting.

### 1. Chessboard tiling problem (Liu C.L Elements of Discrete Mathematics)

Suppose we remove a square from a standard 8x8 chessboard .Given 21 L-shaped triominoes , we want to know whether it is possible to tile the 63 remaining squares of the chessboard with the triominoes. (By tiling the remaining squares of the chess-board, we mean covering each of them exactly once without parts of the triominoes extending over the removed square or the edges of the board.)

### 2. Ore's theorem
