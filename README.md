This repo is to keep note of math theorems/problems/games that I found out to be interesting.

### 1. Chessboard tiling problem (Liu C.L Elements of Discrete Mathematics)

Suppose we remove a square from a standard 8x8 chessboard .Given <img alt="$21$" src="https://rawgit.com/bhi5hmaraj/Interesting-Math-Stuff/master/svgs/a4ffd9a2324f5dcc8182bce900c01465.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width="16.377075pt" height="21.10812pt"/> L-shaped triominoes , we want to know whether it is possible to tile the <img alt="$63$" src="https://rawgit.com/bhi5hmaraj/Interesting-Math-Stuff/master/svgs/d91c711e2b22965b363504970ae9b523.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width="16.377075pt" height="21.10812pt"/> remaining squares of the chessboard with the triominoes. (By tiling the remaining squares of the chess-board, we mean covering each of them exactly once without parts of the triominoes extending over the removed square or the edges of the board.)

### 2. Ore's theorem 
Let <img alt="$G(V, E)$" src="https://rawgit.com/bhi5hmaraj/Interesting-Math-Stuff/master/svgs/faeb185b92f7b3520d81a553e6ec6a90.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width="56.40624pt" height="24.56553pt"/> be a simple graph such that for every pair of **non adjacent** vertices <img alt="$u$" src="https://rawgit.com/bhi5hmaraj/Interesting-Math-Stuff/master/svgs/6dbb78540bd76da3f1625782d42d6d16.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width="9.375135pt" height="14.10255pt"/> and <img alt="$v$" src="https://rawgit.com/bhi5hmaraj/Interesting-Math-Stuff/master/svgs/6c4adbc36120d62b98deef2a20d5d303.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width="8.52588pt" height="14.10255pt"/> , <img alt="$d(u) + d(v) &gt;= |V|$" src="https://rawgit.com/bhi5hmaraj/Interesting-Math-Stuff/master/svgs/4c6af5200b5d3c51784accb4f6be902f.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width="137.382135pt" height="24.56553pt"/> then , <img alt="$G$" src="https://rawgit.com/bhi5hmaraj/Interesting-Math-Stuff/master/svgs/5201385589993766eea584cd3aa6fa13.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width="12.876435pt" height="22.38192pt"/> contains a **Hamiltonian cycle**

### 3. [QED](https://teorth.github.io/QED/) | A game on logic by Prof. Terrance Tao

An interesting game on propositional & first order logic by Prof. Terrance Tao. It's a good practice to get a feel for constructing proofs. You can find my current progress [here](https://github.com/bhi5hmaraj/Interesting-Math-Stuff/blob/master/QED-progress.json) .
